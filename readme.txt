The two ROS packages 'dobot' and 'display' are intended to be provided to students when starting the task sets found in the 'Task_Sets' folder.

These packages are constructed using Catkin.
They may be copied into the /src file of a ROS workspace, and built using 'catkin_make'.

The recommended ROS distribution is Melodic Morenia.
